# Merak Agent Documentation Hub

Welcome to the central index for engineering documentation. This folder gives new contributors the context they need to work on Merak’s hiring agent backend.

## How the Docs Are Organised
- `System/` — architecture and system design references.
- `SOP/` — repeatable procedures (runbooks, testing checklists, migrations, etc.).
- `Tasks/` — PRDs and implementation plans for upcoming or in-flight features.

## Current Documents
| Path | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `System/project_architecture.md` | Project goals, repository layout, key integrations, and request flow. |
| `SOP/manual_testing.md` | Steps to run the backend locally and validate Merak via ChatKit. |
| `Tasks/README.md` | Instructions for adding new PRDs; no active tasks recorded yet. |
| `Tasks/feat-nextjs-chatkit-frontend.md` | PRD and implementation plan for the custom Next.js ChatKit frontend. |
